# iPhoneDatabaseConverter
This repository contains a batch file used to convert iPhone backup files to .png extension. Only for use on PC.

Most of the backup files stored when you sync your phone are photos, so converting them from the 'file' extension to png will give you a lot of photos to browse and take a lot less time to accomplish, as opposed to uploading them.

# Directions
Copy the sub-directories of the iPhone data you want to convert in another directory on your computer. 

*You do not want to remove these files from the iPhone directory, that's why we copy them somewhere else*

Now in the toPNG.bat file, replace 'your_directory_path' with the place you stored the files.

Save and run the batch file in command prompt. When the output stops it means it has converted all the files.

Enjoy your photos.
